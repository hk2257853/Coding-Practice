/*
The above approach may not work for all denominations. For example, it doesnâ€™t work for denominations {9, 6, 5, 1} and V = 11. The above approach would print 9, 1 and 1. But we can use 2 denominations 5 and 6. 
For general input, below dynamic programming approach can be used:

The denominations are of Indian Currency, which is designed in such a way that adding two smaller 
denominations will not be greater than a bigger denomination
