strlen() 
pow(a,b) a^b


char a='1'
int b=(int) a   will output 49. So do -49


a character array is like any other array.
So we can use a char pointer to character array and this
will allows us to use char pointer as string.
ie 
char *name = "Flavio";
printf("%s", name);

in cpp string is there so no issue
