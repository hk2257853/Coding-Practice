Was able to code on my own!!!!

Mistakes:
i++ should have put i + 1
2d dp table... its clear why... i could have figured out... didn't think in that direction


tabulation:
after drawing table briefly I can code out space optimised soln
(I am filling the same big table... jut prev & curr instance is enough... (& by going
right to left... don't need to maintain 2 separate tables...)

mistakes: indices hadling - base case taken so start from 1, should have coded 3 lines of if on my own...

its easy... will get comfortable after doing 3 more...

I am not sure if I'll be able to decide x & y for tabulation
